# Collaborative-Filtering-Netflix-Dataset
Empirical Analysis of Predictive Algorithms for Collaborative Filtering

## Problem Statement

- Read the attached paper on Empirical Analysis of Predictive Algorithms for Collaborative Filtering. You need to read up to Section 2.1, and are encouraged to read further if you have time.
- The dataset we will be using is a subset of the movie ratings data from the Netflix Prize. You need to download it via Elearning. It contains a training set, a test set, a movies file, a dataset description file, and a README file. The training and test sets are both subsets of the Netflix training data. You will use the ratings provided in the training set to predict those in the test set. You will compare your predictions with the actual ratings provided in the test set. The evaluation metrics you need to use are the Mean Absolute Error and the Root Mean Squared Error. The dataset description file further describes the dataset, and will help you get started. The README file is from the original set of Netflix files, and has been included to comply with the terms of use for this data.
- Implement (use Python3 and numpy; the latter is a must for this part) the collaborative filtering algorithm described in Section 2.1 of the paper (Equations 1 and 2; ignore Section 2.1.2) for making the predictions.
